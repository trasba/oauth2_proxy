# Docs

This folder contains our Jekyll based docs site which is hosted at
https://pusher.github.io/oauth2_proxy.

When making changes to this docs site, please test your changes locally:

```bash
make serve
```

To run the docs site locally you will need Ruby at version 2.1.0 or
higher and `bundle` (`gem install bundler` if you already have Ruby).
